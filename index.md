# HKN Outreach

## About

The purpose of this site will be to showcase hands-on engineering projects designed by the Eta-Kappa-Nu (HKN) Outreach program to be taught at K-12 schools. The lessons below contain step-by-step instructions for completing each project, along with a list of required materials, and a bit about how each project works.

## Projects
